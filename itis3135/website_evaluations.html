        <h3><a href="https://www.walmart.com/">Walmart</a></h3>
        <p>Walmart Inc. is an multinational retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, 
            discount department stores, and grocery stores. Walmart originates in the U.S..
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Contrast:</b> The two colors that stand out the most are the semi-dark blue and gold, which 
                matches perfectly with their logo colors. The body of the page is white with black text, but the
                headers stand out due to the bolding and different font. The spacing and shapes are also very
                natural and brings a nice flow. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Repitition:</b> There is a consistent repitition between the layouts when clicking on the menu items. 
                For all the pages there is a sidebar with filters and options. The fonts are also very consistent
                throughout the webpage, as all the text is sans-serif. The menu bar uses white text and the body uses mostly black.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Alignment:</b> The alignment is very natural as all simular elements are located in its own vertical rectangle. All of the 
                sections are perfectly aligned with those above and below it. The menu is aligned in a way that it is very easy to navigate. 
                Content is perfectly centered within its respective border.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Proximity:</b> As stated above, all like elements are contained inside of a vertical rectangle. This allows for like items to be seen as 
                one visual unit instead several disjoint units. This allows for great organization between different products.

        <h3><a href="https://mumbai.craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a></h3>
        <p>
            Craigslist is an American advertisement website, whose categories inlude jobs, 
            housing, for sale items, items wanted, and other services.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>Contrast:</b> The background of the website is white, text is blue and there 
                are light grey containers where headings or menu options are. The contrast isn't 
                bad but when you click on a link the text turns purple and messes up the theme.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Repetition:</b> The repitition is not good because each page of the website seems to have different styling.
                There is no lomger the grey outline when going onto different pages within the site. The fonts are also not 
                consistent as the body includes serif and sans-serif.

            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Alignment:</b> The alignment seems to be off especially on the homepage where it shows all of the categories.
                The sections in the body are also not the same length which throws off the style. 
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>Proximity:</b> All of the elements of the webpage seem to be crowded up in the middle of the page. All of the links 
                are also very close together, and since there are a lot of links to other pages it makes it hard to navigate. 

            </li>

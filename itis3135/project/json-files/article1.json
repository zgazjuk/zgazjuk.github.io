		"description": "An F-16 Fighting Falcon pilot did an unauthorized intercept of a civilian plane before losing control of his fighter jet after hitting the wrong switch and crashing in rural Louisiana this past spring, a new report from the Air Force's Aircraft Accident Investigation Board revealed. \n\nAlexander Drummond, a captain in the Oklahoma Air National Guard who piloted the F-16, safely ejected prior to the March 23 crash. The pilot was publicly identified as the son of Gentner Drummond, an Air Force veteran who was elected as the Republican attorney general of Oklahoma last month, Military.com previously reported.\n\nThe Accident Investigation Board's report did not address the pilot by name. The report, made public for the first time last week, said the F-16 crash resulted in a 'total loss valued at $26,950,985.'\n\n The incident took place during a training exercise March 23 when two F-16s departed Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, Texas. During their mission, the duo encountered a civilian aircraft in a holding pattern at Beauregard Regional Airport in Louisiana. \n\n The Guard pilots decided to do a visual identification intercept to identify the tail number of the plane but did not contact the pilot of the civilian aircraft or air traffic control. \n\nThe accident report found that the pilot of the jet that crashed hit the wrong switch on his aircraft shortly after the maneuver, causing the fighter to start dropping toward the ground."

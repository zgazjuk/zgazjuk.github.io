        <h2>Contract</h2>
        <p>
            I, Zachary D. Gazjuk agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Fall 2022,
            ITIS 3135, Web Development and Design with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
        </p>
        <p>
            I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and
            will not put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins
            or showing up for class. As such, failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also understand that given the structure and content of this class its possible
            to find many examples online or even view my classmates code directly. I swear that I will only use
            these resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where I havei have properly given
            credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from my classmates.
        </p>
